         “One must learn by doing the thing; for though you think you know it, you have no certainty, until you try.”<br>– <b>  Sophocles</b>

    At Simpkins we don’t believe in rote-learning. Children learn actively by doing and understanding. Experiential learning practiced here, is the process of making meaning from direct experience. Research suggests that many of us remember: 10% of what we read; 20% of what we hear; 30% of what we see; 70% of what we discuss with others; 80% of what we experience by doing. Active learning results in long-term recall, synthesis, and problem-solving skills than learning by just hearing, reading, or watching. Simpkins education has moved from a learning-by-telling model and even learning-by-observing, to a learning-by-doing model. We have moved from passivity to activity. Our students learn to extrapolate from their experiences and see how to apply what they’ve done to new instances. Experiential learning is deftly juxtaposed alongside traditional classroom pedagogy to produce global citizens of tomorrow.
