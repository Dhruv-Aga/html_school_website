    <h1>Science Club</h1>
    <div id="moto">“Science is nothing but developed perception, interpreted intent, commonsense rounded out and minutely articulated.”<br>-<b>George Santayana</b> </div>
    <div id="thought">
        The Objectives of the Science Club is to make all students realize that it is a club for real fun and not a place to horrify them with equations and complicated words. All they get here is fun with structured information with repeatable results. It makes them realize that ‘science’ is just a name of easier way of understanding things. The club is equally enjoyable for students who like science or arts or are curious to learn just anything they want.
