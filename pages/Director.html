        My dear Parents, benefactors, students and well wishers,

        I take this opportunity to reach out to each one of you. I always had a staunch belief that the future of a country rests not in the hands of soldiers and merchants but in those of students and scholars. Governed by the same belief I started this school in 1981. Since then we have seen our students grow and excel in all spheres and reach new heights of success. Our constant endeavour has been to provide an ideal system of education which draws out all the faculties of the youth on every side of his nature, develops in him every intellectual and moral power and strengthens him physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually that he may turn out at the end of his schooling, useful citizen and a patriotic, pious person who respects himself and respects those around him. Before I conclude, I express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to parents for their support and co-operation. May Godâ€™s love be with each one of you and may you always remain in His love and care!
