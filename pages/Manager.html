        Dear Respected Patrons and Well Wishers,
        <br> At the very outset, it is my proud privilege to greet you with warm wishes for showers of blessings from the ALMIGHTY GOD. For all parents the education of their children is of the greatest importance and selecting the right school is not an easy task. Simpkins is acknowledged as one of the leading schools in Agra. It is known for curricular and            co-curricular activities combined with flavour of discipline, devotion and dedication with which the management and teaching faculty is committed to take care of the welfare of the students. Our school is a real temple in today’s world, which not only teaches academics but also prepares students for future by inculcating good values. Although tradition is important at Simpkins, yet we are not trapped by the past. We believe in a willingness to adapt to changes. We do not see change as a threat, but as a challenge to build anew. Our school has taken a great leap in the quality of education. Teachers and students are empowered with skills and understanding to thrive in an interactive and information-rich learning environment through enhanced technology. Our amazing and dedicated faculty are to be commended for their zeal, commitment and dedicated service to our institution. I encourage all my teachers and staff to continue working hard for the growth of our school and  extend my warm regards to the Principal, Staff and Students of the School and wish them every success.
