        To enhance the learning ability and skill and impart practical exposure about theoretical concepts, the school has a large number of modern laboratory systems, including – Physics, Chemistry, Biology (Life Sciences), Languages, Mathematics, Social Sciences (History & Geography Museums), Biotechnology and Art & Craft Studio. All these labs are well-equipped with specific apparatus and gadgets, effective and efficient teachers to test ideas of students, help them perform experiments and at all the same time encourage them to make their own discoveries. The budding geniuses gain hands-on-experience in these laboratories by experimenting with the gadgets and verifying the given laws.

        <h1>Maths Lab</h1>
        <div id="thought">
            The Maths Lab is well ventilated, spacious with all modern training equipments. There is ample space for display and the elevated round tables further assist in conducting experiments. Students are made to understand difficult concepts by doing activities that verify, discover and reinforce concepts already learnt. There are many puzzles and games that make learning fun. Students verify Geometrical theorems using Tangrams and verify Euler’s formula by using Jodo sticks and creating 3-D figures. There are activities like Rangometry where students create beautiful designs using triangles, squares, pentagons etc. thus making learning meaningful and multisensorial. Children are encouraged to hone their mental arithmetic through quizzes and enrichment activities. All these activities boosts the confidence level of the students and develops a positive approach towards learning Mathematics. It inculcates an out-of-the-box thinking and enables them to relate Mathematics to their day-to-day life.
