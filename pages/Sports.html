        Sports and games take their rightful place in the lives of Simpkins students at whether they seek high-level competition or recreation. The benefits of physical activity for the young are manifold. Sports give an opportunity to develop their physical skills and to remain healthy and active, while experiencing the pleasure of achievement. The mental and physical strength, self-discipline, rigour and practice required to excel help them gain confidence in all that they do as a part of a team. This also teaches them the qualities of self-control, self-esteem and leadership and develops the characteristics of a true team player and sportsperson, attributes that will be of value later in life. The blend of the joy of winning and the pain of defeat experienced in the sporting arena helps the individual to be balanced, cope with failure and empathize with his opponents and his team when faced with defeat. The sporting activities offered at the School include aerobics, athletics, badminton, basketball, chess, cricket, football, hill walking and camp craft, judo, karate, table tennis, taekwondo, throwball, volleyball and yoga. Periodically horse-riding and swimming sessions are also arranged for the students. The School conducts an annual sports meet and holds inter-house competitions in most of the sports mentioned above.
