        Simpkins methodology concentrates first on the student’s aptitudes, then on the skills and knowledge s/he needs to acquire. We recognise that individual students have different ‘intelligences’. So, we aim to give students a broader, deeper, richer educational experience by recognising each student’s strongest talents and building on them in order to ensure that all the areas of talent are developed. Linguistics is developed here through such activities as creative writing, literature, foreign language learning, theatre, debating and public speaking. Logical-Mathematical skills are honed through such activities as Science and Maths projects and experiments and industrial design. For musical talent we provide opportunities for playing, directing, studying and composing classical and contemporary music. Bodily-Kinesthetic is promoted through sports and athletics, yoga, modelling, contemporary and classical dance. For Spatial aptitude we have sculpture, photography drawing and painting. Naturalist inclination expresses itself through ecology, gardening, wild-life observation, biological and chemical experiments. Inter-Personal skill which is imperative for a socially and professionally successful life is developed at Simpkins through activities like group projects, peer teaching and counselling, media work (including student magazines and the Yearbook) and exchange programmes. Intra-Personal needs are addressed through self-awareness training, counselling and the creation of physical and personal space for meditation, reflection and tranquility.
