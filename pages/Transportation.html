        Simpkins School with a strength of approximately 3,500 students and 250 staff members, requires a most efficient transport department. School provides, transport facility to the students from almost every corner of the city. Our school buses are- safe, well maintained and child-friendly. Each bus is driven by a well trained driver and has the presence of an attendant to escort the child. This department plays a pivotal role in coordinating the school buses essential for ferrying students from different parts of the city to the school and vice-versa. This department also holds the additional responsibility of arranging vehicles for visitors, for recreational activities like school picnics, and to send students to participate in various inter-school activities.
