        The excellent and dedicated staff at Simpkins School receives training periodically. Professional training weeks are held prior to and at the end of each academic session, during which all teachers review and further develop their teaching practice under the guidance of the Director, Principal and the Senior Management Team. Our continuous and comprehensive In-Service Orientation, Teachers’ Exchange Programmes, Education and Training Programmes for Teachers through self-motivated school based activities and incentives, take care of not only imparting information about changes in syllabi & latest trends in education but also tackle issues like stress management, improved communication, effective teaching methods etc.. Further, the School has its own Resource Centre to ensure that all its teachers employ innovative and effective teaching methods, and are thoroughly conversant with their subjects, updating content and methodology continually.
