        To encourage and support long-term, mutually-supportive, caring inter-generational relationships Simpkins hosts a number of events in the school. The main objective of celebrating Grandparents Day, Parents Day, Mothers Day in school is to foster community relations and boost family involvement in schools. Children whose families are involved in their education learn better. These activities expose children to new ideas from a historical, multigenerational, and life course perspective and creates a community that remembers its history as it builds its future.
