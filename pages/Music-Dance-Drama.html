        A substantial number of hours in the timetable and ample opportunity after school, are dedicated to encouraging children to explore a wide range of creative pursuits. Time spent on music, drama and dance, is time well spent. The pleasures in doing and the satisfaction of achievement not only tap students’ creativity and originality, but also encourage their concentration, patience, commitment and teamwork. Specialist teachers for these subjects, working in the areas designed for their activities, ensure that the pleasures and rewards of creative work complement academic study. To maximise the music skills, the school provides fully equipped music room with Indian and Western instruments viz. – Tabla, Harmonium, Violin, Guitar, Dholak, Key Board, Congo, Drums etc
