        As an academic space, the Meditation Room facilitates the mental training and interior rigour implicit in the dictum “know thyself”. With just the right interiors, this serene space is invitational to mental calm and inner peace. The Meditation Room offers silent refuge for all students, faculty and staff. Several faculty members teach contemplation-based curricular courses in the Meditation Room. Introductory Meditation classes vary and include: Qigong, Zen Meditation, Deep Relaxation, T’ai Chi Ch’uan, Sufi Dance, Christian Contemplative Prayer, Walking Meditation, Feldenkrais, and of course, our very own Yoga.
