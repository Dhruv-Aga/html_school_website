        <h1>Water Play</h1>
        <div id="thought">
            Scorching heat brings opportunity for water-play where children play with reckless abandon. Water play delights the senses and is far more than simply pleasurable for young children. This type of sensory play is important for the development of the young child. Water play is good for children’s physical, mental (cognitive), and social-emotional growth. When children pour water, they are improving their physical dexterity and eye-hand coordination. Not just with the pre-primary kids, the water-play is a super-hit even with our primary students.
