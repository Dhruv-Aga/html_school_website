        Seasonal, national and religious festivals renew our awareness of the rhythms of the year and foster the children’s relationship to the world into which they grow. Many festivals are celebrated during the school year and each festival may be observed differently according to the class and teacher. The whole school celebrates some festivals, and others are celebrated only by the pre-primary. Additional festivals may also be included during the year, according to the curriculum and class diversity. Although many of the festivals we celebrate are associated with particular world religions, the school is secular in its outlook and is committed to providing education to all students, without any prejudice. Also, special assemblies are dedicated to mark all the important national and international days viz. World Computer Day, World Book Day, National Science Day, Hiroshima Day, Human Rights Day, National Youth Day, World Environment Day, Earth Day, Heritage Day, Water Day..
