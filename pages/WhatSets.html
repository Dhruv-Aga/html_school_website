        The faculty at Simpkins is a highly dedicated and a professional team, with the special qualities of patience and understanding that distinguish a good teacher. They are dynamic, relaxed and enthusiastic with the ability to create a friendly atmosphere in which the child can express himself and learn. Teachers, as facilitators, guide and counsellors encourage the development of each child by providing security & warmth and emphasizing self-discipline. Never satisfied with tried and tested measures, they delight in creating more effective ways to explore and share knowledge thus breathing life into their teaching, thereby, enabling the children to go beyond rote learning. The student – teacher ratio is 12:1, which is exceptionally good.
